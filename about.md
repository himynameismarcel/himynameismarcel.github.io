<h3>Hi, my name is Marcel! </h3>

<p>I am Austro-Iranian Economist and grew up in the mountains drinking tea. Throughout my diploma studies (during which the term <em>data scientist</em> was not yet well established/known) I made my fateful encounter with Econometrics<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> after which one thing led to the other: I caught fire and dived into the subject in the course of a Master's program in <em>Applied Economics</em> which soon brought me in contact with R<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and at the same time taught me the beauty of programming. </p>
<p>While I never really understood the value of blogging, in a recent job interview for a position as an analyst I was asked if I could show some stuff I was working on. And because I could not (apart from two<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> articles that I co-authored), I became aware of the purpose of a dedicated online portfolio.</p>
<p>The last missing puzzle piece that finally made me sit down and create a blog was an article published on <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/">R-bloggers</a>. The argument was convincing: blogging can foster your own learning-path and journey throughout topics of your own interest. And by writing and publishing something you make sure to research as good as you can about a certain topic. At the same time you expose yourself to a huge community through which you can connect to peers and receive valuable feedback.</p>
<p>This blog is hence dedicated to my journey to all things <em>economics</em>, <em>data</em> (primarily in R and Python) as well <em>programming</em> more general.</p>


<h3>In My Spare Time</h3>
  <p>Besides my work and all of the above, I'm a passionate musician. I play the piano and make music in various bands/projects or write songs. I take the liberty to also publish some music on this blog as soon as I figured out a good way to do that.</p>
