The upcoming 'Meeting of the Expert Group on Business Registers' will take place
from 27-29 September at the OECD in Paris. The program of the meeting is
available on the [UNECE's homepage](https://www.unece.org/index.php?id=44252).

The contribution that I wrote together with my colleagues Sara Thijs, Peter Neudorfer and Sandrine Corvoisier is included in the part about
'Registers and globalisation' and is available [here](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.42/2017/ECB.pdf).
The accompanying presentation is available [here](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.42/2017/ECB_ppt.pdf).
